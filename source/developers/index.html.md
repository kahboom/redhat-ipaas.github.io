# Introduction

This guide assumes that you are either a developer or contributor of Syndesis. If you are looking for a guide to teach you the ins and outs of Syndesis and how to use it, please refer to the [User Guide](../users/index.html).

## How to Use this Guide

You may have noticed some tabs on the right-hand side. These tabs are there to assist you with the different areas involved in Syndesis, and how they pertain to each model.


# Architecture

_A visual diagram of the Syndesis architecture is currently underway._

Syndesis can be run on OpenShift or Kubernetes, on the cloud or on premises. Under the hood it uses Apache Camel magic to allow for a seamless integration between a wide array of web services, along with the flexibility to create new Camel connectors for your own custom needs, should we not already provide them OOTB.

<blockquote class="area-specific ui">
The UI is built with Angular 2, TypeScript, and Webpack.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="area-specific backend">
The backend is written mostly in Java, using open source technologies like Camel.

# Getting Started

## Syndesis API

The API can be run locally or you can use the staging API. If you'll strictly be working on the UI, or just want to get the app running as quickly as possible, we recommend using the API staging server rather than running it locally.

```json
{
  "apiEndpoint": "https://syndesis-staging.b6ff.rh-idev.openshiftapps.com/api/v1",
  "title": "Syndesis",
  "datamapper": {
    "baseJavaServiceUrl": "https://localhost:8585/v2/atlas/java/",
    "baseMappingServiceUrl": "https://localhost:8585/v2/atlas/"
  },
  "oauth": {
    "clientId": "syndesis-ui",
    "scopes": [],
    "oidc": true,
    "hybrid": true,
    "issuer": "https://syndesis-staging.b6ff.rh-idev.openshiftapps.com/auth/realms/syndesis",
    "auto-link-github": true
  }
}
```

### Staging API

This is the easiest way to get started with making contributions in the UI. Fork the `syndesis-ui` repository to your desktop, and look for the `./src/config-example.json` file. Copy and paste it, renaming it to `config.json`. Open it up and toward the top it should look something like the example provided on the right.

The `oauth.issuer` property should also be changed to `https://syndesis-staging.b6ff.rh-idev.openshiftapps.com/auth/realms/syndesis`.

### Locally

If you'd like to run the API locally, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file [here](https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-rest).


## Syndesis UI

<aside class="notice">
You must first set up the API by following the instructions above.
</aside>

1. Fork the `syndesis-ui` located [here](https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-ui).
2. Clone your fork to your desktop.
3. Build with `yarn`.
4. Run with `ng serve`.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.


## Data Mapper

To set up the data mapper, be sure to include the `dataMapper` property in your `config.json` file.

```json
{
  "datamapper": {
    "baseJavaServiceUrl": "https://localhost:8585/v2/atlas/java/",
    "baseMappingServiceUrl": "https://localhost:8585/v2/atlas/"
  }
}
```

# Tests

## System Tests

[This](https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-system-tests) is the repository you can clone to run system-wide tests. These tests are meant to be run against OpenShift (either within or pointing to an Openshift installation).

For instance, to run them locally you'd run the following:
`mvn clean test`

## E2E Tests

Our E2E tests use Cucumber and Gherkin. Cucumber is a great way to make sure that tests follow the narrative for each sprint.

</ul>

## Unit Tests

### Running Test Suites Individually

Be sure to click on the QE tabs on the right-hand side to learn how to run each suite of tests individually. We try to write unit tests for all repositories, both on the frontend and the backend.

# Connections

Everyday in your day-to-day operations you use several web services, such as Salesforce, to complete tasks. In Syndesis, we refer to configured versions of each web service and a specific task, collectively, as a Connection.

An example of a Connection is a "Twitter mention", configured with your Twitter account details. As you'll see later, you use one or more Connections to create an Integration (more on this later).

## Creating Connections

<blockquote class="area-specific design">
<a href="" title="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="" title=""></a>
</blockquote>

There are a few places you can go to create a Connection.

1. From the Dashboard, scroll down to the Dashboard: Connections section, and click on the Create Connection button on the right-hand side OR navigate to Connections on the left-hand navigation bar, and then click on the Create Connection button on the upper right-hand side.
2. Select a web service from the list available.
3. Configure your web service.
4. Validate it to make sure the Connection has been configured properly.
5. Give your Connection a name and description. If you don't, one will be generated for you automatically.
6. Press the Create Connection button.
7. $$ PROFIT!

If you navigate to the Connection List you should now see your newly created Connection.

## Connection List

In the Connection List you can see a list of Connections you've created. This is also where you can select a Connection to edit it.

## Editing Connections

Editing a Connection is really simple. Go to the Connection List, locate the Connection you'd like to edit, and click on it. You can also select the kabob on the right-hand side of the Connection card, which opens up a small dropdown menu, and select 'Edit Connection'.

Then, simply make your changes and save them.

# Integrations

Integrations use one or more Connections to, well, integrate data from the web services you use. As mentioned above, Connections are pre-configured actions for your web services (e.g. Twitter mention). You can think of Integrations as a knot that results from tying the ends of two ropes together, where each rope is a Connection.

The beauty of Integrations in Syndesis is that not only can you integrate actions from multiple web services, but you can also work with the data gathered from each Connection using the concept of Steps. When you create an Integration and choose the Connections you'd like to integrate, you are then prompted to either add in another Connection or add a Step in between. An example of a Step might be data mapping or logging.

<blockquote class="area-specific notes">
When Integrations are created, they are activated automatically and persisted on GitHub. Once your Integration is deployed, you will be able to see that a new repository has been created on the authorized GitHub account.
</blockquote>

## Creating Integrations

<blockquote class="area-specific design">
<code>Create Integration: From Scratch</code>

<img src="/images/designs/integrations/create/From-Scratch.png" alt="Create an Integration from Scratch">
</a>
</blockquote>

To create an Integration, click Integrations on the left-hand navigation bar. Then click on the Create Integration button on the upper right-hand side.

## Integration List

In the Integration List you can see a list of Integrations you've created. This is also where you can monitor their overall metrics, or select an Integration to edit it.


### Integration List: Empty

This is the state of the Integration List before you have created any Integrations.

# Tags

Tags are great for keeping things organized. At the moment, you can assign multiple Tags to Integrations, Connections, and Templates. In the near future, you will also be able to sort by Tags.

## Creating Tags

When you are creating an Integration, you will see a field for Tags. Start typing and you'll see a list of suggestions based on existing Tags. If the Tag you want doesn't already exist, simply type the name of the Tag you would like to create, and press Enter--it will create the Tag for you. 

## Managing Tags

At the moment, it is not possible to manage Tags. Once they are created they cannot be edited. We will be adding in the ability to edit and manage your Tags in a future release.

# Templates

Templates will be available in a future release.

Pull requests are always welcome. Please be sure to read through this entire guide before opening up 
a pull request.

## Getting Started
- Fork the repository you'd like to collaborate on.
- Clone your fork of that repository, NOT the original repository directly.
- Follow instructions on the README.md of the repository to install any dependencies. This 
varies from repository to repository.

## Guidelines

These are guidelines for consistency and to make everyone's lives easier, but we welcome contributors of all levels of expertise and will work with you to try and follow these best practices. An open source community is just that - a community - not a panel of experts. :)

### Tests
- Please write unit tests for all of your code.
- If you are contributing to the Client, please also add to the E2E tests as well.
- Make sure all tests pass prior to creating a PR. If you make a PR with tests running and then make changes, please re-run those tests again just to be sure they are all passing with your new changes.


### Creating PRs
- Please reference any GitHub issue relevant.
- Add user readable descriptions of the changes this PR brings if merged in.
- Screenshots are almost always helpful unless the changes are very minor or if it's just pure code. 
Use your judgment here. UI changes almost always translate into screenshots being helpful.
 
If you get stuck at all, don't hesitate to contact us via the mailing list at ipaas-dev@redhat.com. Hope this helps!
